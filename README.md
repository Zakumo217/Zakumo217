- 👋 Hello, I'm Zakumo; however you can call me by my real name 'James'
- 👀 As of the current moment I'm interested in general knowledge of the IT field; as time goes on I know I'll figure out what specific programs/field I'll be interested in.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3.0, also is my first program language and entry to learn programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to continue and expand my knowledge as much as I can.
- I've only started as of mid-June this year entirely.
- 📫 How to reach me ... (Will create later)
